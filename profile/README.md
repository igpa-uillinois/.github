## About This Project

Illinois has struggled for decades with persistent fiscal pressures. Fiscal Futures tracks and analyzes the Fiscal Gap. It also dives into the  data for each of these topics:
- Own-source revenues and federal transfers  
- Medicaid, healthcare, and social spending  
- Pensions, debt, and tax refunds  
- K–12 education and other state investments  

This repository contains the datasets and analysis code that power the Fiscal Futures work.

## Origins and Stewardship

This project was **founded and developed by David Merriman and Richard Dye**

The documentation, website, and data structure was created by **Alea Wilbur-Mujtaba**, who continues to contribute analysis, code, and reports.  Many PhD students have contributed to collecting the data each year and assisted with past reports.

The **Institute of Government and Public Affairs (IGPA), University of Illinois**, serves as the institutional steward of Fiscal Futures. IGPA will also host additional research projects across public finance, policy, and governance.
